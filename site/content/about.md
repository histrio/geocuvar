# About

The tool was developed as a replacement for the WhoDidIt tool. Its purpose is to monitor specific regions, starting with Montenegro, 
for any changes. The tool includes a list of changesets filtered by a bounding box (bbox) and uses tags to allow users to view changes within particular regions.
